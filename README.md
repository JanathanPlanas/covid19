## Jupyterlab extensions ##

These are some useful jupyterlab extensions that you might want to install
through jupyterlab. The "server part" of the extensions that have a server part
are listed as dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and should already be installed
with the `poetry install` command. Thus, you only need to install the client
part.
